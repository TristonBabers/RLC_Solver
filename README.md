# RLC_Solver
Solves RLC circuits via a website interface, implemented in C++. For more information, see [TristonBabers.com/rlc-solver](TristonBabers.com/rlc-solver).

## Overview
This repository contains the backend code for my website's RLC_Solver. It is designed to solve circuits consisting of only resistors, capacitors, and inductors calculating the theoretical voltages and currents across each component.

## To Do List:
1. Choose an appropriate design pattern to model the RLC Circuit and the solver. **<==**
2. Figure out how data from the website will be received by my backend. (Most likely JSON)
3. Create an architectural design map.
4. Define the header .hpp files for each of the classes.
5. Consider potential future features to be implemented and revise .hpp files as needed.
6. Write test cases for each .hpp class.
7. Review algorithms to solve RLC circuits.
8. Begin implementing .hpp files.
9. Testing code and debugging.
10. Implement front-end user interface
11. More testing and debugging.

## Setup Information
-Will be updated eventually.
