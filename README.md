# RLC_Solver
Solves RLC circuits via a website interface, implemented in C++. For more information, see [TristonBabers.com/rlc-solver](https://tristonbabers.com/rlc-solver/).

## Overview
This repository contains the backend code for my website's RLC_Solver. It is designed to solve circuits consisting of only resistors, capacitors, and inductors calculating the theoretical voltages and currents across each component.

## To Do List:
- ~~Now that the algorithm is working soundly, I want to ensure that front-end computation is possible. This means that when I change the frequency of the circuit, the node voltages and component currents are recalculated on the front-end; so every calculation must be performed symbolically.~~
- **C++ Portion of Coding is DONE!!!**
- ~~Need to figure out Javascript portion of code base.~~
- Add pHp file for CGI transfer of data back and forth from the program on the server side to the client side web page.

## Setup Information
-Will be updated eventually.
